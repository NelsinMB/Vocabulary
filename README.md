# Vocabulary (To be renamed later)

Suppose you come across a word you don't know the meaning of. If you are like me in the past, you create a definitino using the context of the situation, or if you are like me in the present and using a Kindle, you check the definition simply by holding down. Yet, the next night (or even later the same night), you have to repeat the process for a word that you know you've checked. The issue is, you never created a system to review the word, and who wants to review words while they are on their way to dreamland. \\

For memorization based learning, two components of learning have been demonstrated to be particularly important: active recall and spaced repetition. A youtuber I used to watch, Ali Abdaal introduced me to these two concepts, and there is software such as Anki that are intended provide systems for people to implement spaced repetition, with some emphasis on active recall. In my opinion, there are many issues with how people use Anki and I believe that the process can be made better. At a later date, I'll write more about what I do and don't like about other software systems. \\

Anyway, in this particular situation, I want a system where I can tell my phone (or other device) to add a word to my vocabulary list and let it do the rest of the work. I'm starting with this, but I hope to expand this to incorporate much more - I have a lot of ideas generated as a result of my time studying. \\

A revision project, in some manner or form, has been on my mind since at least the tenth grade (I'll write more about the inspiration in a separate section).
